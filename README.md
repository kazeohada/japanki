# Japanki - Work In Progress!

A Python Eel and React.JS application that automatically creates japanese vocabulary Anki flashcards.

Initially a CLI-based application, as I wanted something small that worked for me to be done as soon as I could, but I'm planning on expanding it into a Desktop application!

Some plans that I have for it:
- Kanji flashcards
- Searching for words based on a category, such as: JLPT level, Verbs, words that use a speicific kanji, etc...
- User can upload their own Anki card template and create flashcards with it
- User can create their own Anki cards using a GUI-based card editor, as opposed to pure HTML as it is required by Anki
